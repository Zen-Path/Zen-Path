## Hello World üåç

I'm a CS student working as a QA Engineer focused on mobile automation testing. When I'm not squashing (or adding) bugs, you can find me tinkering with my Arch Linux setup *(btw)* and writing various scripts to boost my workflow. Check out my dots [here](https://github.com/Zen-Path/flexycon).
